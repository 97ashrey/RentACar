# Rent a car
Multiuser desktop application for renting cars, built in c# programming language. This project is still in development.
## Motivation
This project is an asignment for c# course at my school, aside from that this is a perfect opportunity to implement and gain better understanding of design patterns. 
## Built with

 - C#
 - Windows Forms
 - Model View Presenter
## Features
This application consists of admin and customer sides. Admins have full crud control over the application data, while users can only see their reservation, cancle them or make new ones.

## Conclusion
In the time i've been working on this i have learned some pretty cool things in c#. Mainly the ability to extend existing objects and types using extension methods. I also realised that knowing JavaScript helped me understand delegates and events realy fast, thus i could transfer some JavaScript knowledge and adapt it to c# ecosystem.
